BEAUTY doesn’t make love but love makes BEAUTY ;
BREAK everything but never BREAK the HEART;
HEART is the music, PLAY it but never play WITH it.
Love hurts when you break up with some one.
Hurts even more when someone breaks up with you But love hurts
the most when the person, you love has no idea how you feel.
Love is like a Ice Cube,
D Harder U Hold on to it, D faster It’ll disappear.
Al you’ll have in ur hand will B Tears of Crushed Love…
U promised 2 take care of me but u hurt me,
U promised me 2 bring me joy but u brought me tears,
U promised me ur Love but u gave me PAIN… ME?
I promised u Nothing but I gave u Everything!
Never talk about feelings,
if they aren’t really there
Never hold my hand,
if you going to break my heart
Never say you are going to,
if you don’t plan to start
Never look in my eyes,
if all you do is lie
Never say hello,
if you really mean goodbye
Heart is equal to a mirror, Mirror shows reflection, &
Heart shows affection.
Both have one equal quality,
can’t be reformed once broken.!
The Body Is A House Of Many Windows :
There We All Sit, Showing Ourselves
And Crying On The Passers-By To Come And Love Us.
There Have Been Times,
When I Have Deliberately,
Tried To Take My Life,
I Think I Must Have Been,
Crying For Some Attention.
Crying Is Right At Hand,
In The Smothering Dark,
Closed Inside Someone Else,
When You See How Everything,
You Can Ever Accomplish,
Will End Up As Trash.
When You Were Born,
You Cried And Every Body Else Was Happy.
The Only Question That Matters Is This : When You Die,
Will You Be Happy When Everybody Else Is Crying?
You Know Somebody,
And They Cry For You.
They Stay Awake At Night,
And Dream Of You.
I Bet You Never ,
Even Know They Do,
But Somebody Crying For You.
The Day Was The Last
The Day Was Gone
The Day Was Sad
The Day Made Me Mad
B’coz You Left My Heart

The pain is not on the day of missing our dear ones.
The pain is really when u live without them
&
with their presence in your mind.
When I m Dead,
Ur Tears May Flow,
But I Wont Know,
Cry 4 Me Now, Instead..
When I m Dead,
U ll Send Flowers,
But I Wont See,
Send them Now, Instead..
When I M Dead,
U ll Say Words Of Praise,But I Wont Hear,
Praise Me Now, Instead..
When I M Dead,
U ll 4get My Faults,
But I Wont Know,
4get them Now, INSTEAD…!
Broken is a star tonight
as tears rolled on to my cheeks
they whispered in my ears
let us take your pain away
broken is a little heart tonight
Some battles have to be fought alone,
Some paths have to be crossed alone,
So never be emotionally attached with someone,
You never know when u have to walk alone…
When I Realized I Found That
I Have Lost My Precious Time To Get Something
Which Was Neither Mine
Nor Matters To My Life
Being Signal Is Cool
No Worrying About Any1,
No Obligations &
Best Of All,No Heartaches
But U Know What?
If U’ll Never Get Ur Heart Broken,
U’ll Never Learn 2 Love
IF U lovE sum1 donT keeP him iN uR hearT!

Moon said to me,
if ur friend is not messaging u,
why don’t you leave ur friend.
I looked at moon and said
does ur sky ever leave u when u don’t shine.
Keeping a FRIEND is As Difficult AS losing one.
U sacrifice A lot To keep them.
I may not have sacrificed enough 4 u…
but in my HEART I swear I’m keeping U
The one who likes you most,
sometimes hurts you,
but again he is the only one who feels your pain.
A daily thought…
A silent tear…
A Constant wish that u r near…
Words are few but thoughts r deep…
Memories of our friendship i’ll always keep!!
Sometimes in life we think we don’t need anyone.
But sometime we don’t have anyone when we need…
So don’t let your best buddies go ever…

Psychological Fact:
When A Person Cries Due To Happiness
The 1st Drop Of Tears Comes From The Right Eye.
But
When It 1st Comes From The Left,
Its Pain
So Many Hands In 1 Tiff-in Box
So Many Friends In 1 Bench.
So Many Calls On 1 B?day Night.
So Many Tears 4 1 Little Fight
Friends! R D Best Part Of Our Life
Each Drop Of Tears R More Costly then
Anything In D World,
But Evry1 Can?t Know the Value
Until they View Tears
In Der Own Eyes 4 Sum1
may b I am wrong but the Person who Loves U,
will Fight with
U more
but
if
U drop a tear
he will Fight the world to Stop Ur tears?
Unseen i Suffer.
Unheard i Cry.
In Agony i Linger.
In Silence i Die.
Is It Nothing To You???
WHY DID U LEAVE ME?
WHY DID U SAY U LOVE ME?
WHY DID U HURT ME?
WHY U LOVE ME SO MUCH…THAT I C,NT BREATH
WHY DID U KISS ME?
WHY DID HOLD ME?
WHY DID WE DO THE THINGS WE DID?
WHY WONT U TALK TO ME?
WHY WONT U LOVE ME?
WHY CANT WE BE FRIENDS?
WHY CANT IT BE THE WAY
“Shakespeare
said:
“Death is not the greatest loss in life,
“The greatest loss is when relationship dies inside us while we are alive..!!
A Complicated Thought:
The saddest things in life r
to remember d happiest moments
of d past which
seems unlikely 2 happen again in life time!
We Don’t Succeed In Our 1st Love!
B’coz We Lack Certain Qualities.
But
After Achieving Those Qualities,
We Never Love Again!
Some people hurt by words & some by action…
But the biggest hurt i believe is
that someone ignoring u
when u value them bigger than anything else!
We enjoy warmth because we have been cold.
We appreciate light because we have been in darkness.
By the same token,
we can experience joy because we have known sadness.
A Person Who Laughs More
And
Makes Others Laugh
Would Be Having
A Thunder Storm Sadness
Beneath His Heart.

A heart breaking isn’t always as loud as a bomb exploding Sometimes it can b as quiet as a feather falling & The most painful thing is, no one really hears it except U.
Even though, she hates me in every movement of life , but i love her with very seconds, not because she has broken my heart, but she as thought me to live with broken heart.
No Matter
How Bad Your
Heart Is Broken…
The World
Doesn’t Stop For
Your Grief … !!
Stay Happy
“Separation”
Is A Wound
That
No One Can “Heal”
But
“Remembrance”
Is A Gift
That
No One Can “Steal”
Keep Your Memories Intact
Some Broken Heart, May Never Mend,
Some Memories May Never End,
Some Wet Tears May Never Dry,
But My Love For You Will Never Die…
If its taking all ur strength…
if its killing your heart…
if its making you bear too much pain…
its making you ignore everything else…
make sure its worth it…
Otherwise…
Let it go…
Its Not When I Look Back At All
The Memories & Good Times
We Had Makes Me Sad
Its When U Consider Those
Memories As Nothing To U
When They Meant
Everything To Me

Its A Boulevard That
I’m Searching For

There Is A Crowd
Around Me At All Times
Its a Friend That I’m

That I’ve Lost
May Be Its ‘ME’ That
I’m Searching For !!

Be Okay
Hidden Away My
Feelings Are
Showing No Emotions Is
How I Am
I Have To Fight
To Be Alive
I Have To Pretend
To Care
The World Crushed
My Dream
Yet It Forces Me To be
I Once Was Alive
Now I Just Survive
Forget the times he walked by,
Forget the times he made you cry,
Forget the times he spoke your name,
Remember now your not the same.
Forget the times he held your hand,
Forget the sweet things if you can,
Forget the times & don’t pretend,
Remember now he’s just your friend.
